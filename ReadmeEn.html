	<h4>At start</h4>
	<p>		
	Button "Filling demo data again" - erases all data,
and then - creates and writes 3 random records to the table.
This button must be pressed at the first start or after deleting the table.

	<p>
		The button "Filling additional demo data" creates and writes 100 random records to the table.
	</p>
	<h4>Filtration</h4>
	<p>		
		The Min and Max fields are a filter by age.
	</p>
	<p>
		The table filters by one age when filling in the field - "Min".
The table filters by age range when filling in the fields - "Min" and "Max".
To disable the filter by age, you must delete the values from the cells - "Min" and "Max".
	</p>
	<h4>Removal</h4>
	<p>
		The "Delete" button deletes records from the table without asking for confirmation.
Button "Clear table" - completely erases all records of the table.
	</p>
	<h4>Sorting</h4>
	<p>
		Sorting is carried out by clicking on the name of the corresponding column.
For example, to sort by age, we click on Age. <br>
The appearance of an up arrow "▲" indicates sorting in ascending order. <br>
The appearance of the down arrow "▼" indicates sorting in descending order.
		</p><p>
		If sorting is not needed and you want to return to the original state of the table -
it is recommended to sort by record id by clicking - Number 1 time. <br> An up arrow should appear next to the Number heading.
